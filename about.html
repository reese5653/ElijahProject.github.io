                    <h2>About Elijah Project School of Ministry</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Elijah Project School of Ministry - a place dedicated to training and equipping laborers for God's harvest field.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ronald and Marilyn Green serve as the Pastors of Short Creek Church in Mulga, AL, a little town right outside of Birmingham, Alabama. From a troubled past and many mistakes which eventually led to a 2 and a half year prison sentence, God's love and grace has turned Pastor Ronald Green's life around to inspire others to live passionate lives for Jesus Christ.</p>
                    
                    <p>After a visitation from the Lord in a county jail cell, God commissioned Ron and Marilyn to raise up Gen Z and millennials to prepare the way for the return of the Lord. Ron and Marilyn are blessed to have many spiritual children while having 7 of their own. Their passion and desire is to see a generation passionately pursue their purpose in God.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through our 16 comprehensive modules, students will journey from foundational biblical studies to advanced theological concepts, gaining the knowledge and skills needed for effective ministry.</p>
